# SSH implementation petting zoo

This repository contains tooling to build and test various SSH
protocol implementations. It is mostly intended to be used for
debugging and regression testing OpenSSH against a wider variety
of endpoints that we can reasonably fit in the built-in tests.

This is still a work in progress.

## Caution

Some of the versions here are obsolete and are likely to contain
security bugs, so don't expose them to hostile input.
